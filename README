dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need: git xorg xserver-xorg linux-headers firmware-linux-free mesa-utils wget curl build-essential

Recommended dependencies for matty's build: picom, feh, nautilus, pulseaudio, firefox, terminator, fontawesome, dmenu, xorg-xsetroot

additional dependencies may be required depending on which modules you choose for dwm-bar in MattyDWM/dwm-bar/dwm-bar.sh. see https://github.com/joestandring/dwm-bar#current-functions
for more information
------------
git clone into your Projects folder in the home directory


Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following lines to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx, or alternatively a .xsession file in your home directory.
I prefer using the .xsession file personally. replace all instance of USER with your username

!#/bin/bash

# Statusbar
/home/USER/Projects/dwm-bar/MattyDWM/dwm_bar.sh &

#Prefer maximum performance with nvidia driver, not relevant unless you have both a nvidia driver and the nvidia-settings GUI
#nvidia-settings -a "[gpu:0]/GpuPowerMizerMode=1" &

#Set a random desktop background, requires feh. you only need one path per monitor. in this example it is telling feh to
choose a background from the Backrounds folder in your home directory at random and scale it (once for each monitor)
feh --bg-scale --randomize ~/Backgrounds ~/Backgrounds  &

#start my window compositor. the picom.conf file can be edited in order to change compositor behavior on startup.
there are a lot of options and it's all really nicely commented.

picom -b --config /home/USER/Projects/MattyDWM/picom.conf &

# start my window manager
exec dwm


In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)



Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
